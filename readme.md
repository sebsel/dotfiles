# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Not everything is in use (I try things out and then forget) and most of it is not my own idea (I try to attribute where I get it from if it's a longer thing).

# Some of my own ideas

- in Vim, I use `gy` to yank into the system register, saving me from having to type out `"+y` all the time.
